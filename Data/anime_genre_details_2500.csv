Moreover, he is forbidden to work as a detective, having barely escaped execution after getting involved in a murder case while he was still attending the school. Ron's situation changes drastically when police detective Totomaru Isshiki, following the advice of a senior colleague, seeks him out for help with a criminal case that has remained unsolved for months. Ron reluctantly agrees to help Totomaru and uses his phenomenal intuition to discover the culprit in less than a day. However, it appears that Ron suffers from a mysterious condition that can cause those around him to lose their lives. To Ron's great surprise, Totomaru manages to save the life of someone whom Ron put in jeopardy.

As the unlikely duo starts solving crimes one after another, BLUE sends operatives after its former student to find out if he has resumed investigative work. Fighting against murderers, rogue detectives, and the Metropolitan Police Department, Ron and Totomaru must join forces if they want to survive and see justice prevail.

As Kasahara does all she can to become worthy of the LTF and unravel her enigmatic superior's motivations, she wages war—both on the battlefield and in her personal life.

Before now, Miko enjoyed her unassuming high school days, with late-night horror shows serving only as a form of entertainment. But ever since one fateful day, she is the only person aware of the invisible monsters walking freely among humans.

Courageously, Miko makes a bold decision: she will never, under any condition, acknowledge the presence of the horrid specters. However, even though she pretends they do not exist, she can still see how they disturb the people around her, especially her best friend, the energetic and lovely Hana Yurikawa. In order to protect them from the monsters' annoyances, Miko gives it her best to continue her school life and avoid every troublesome crisis—even when they scare her to tears.

Or, at the very least, they pretend to be the city's defenders. In reality, the Colors are just three young girls: the shy Yui Akamatsu, the noisy Sacchan, and the video game-loving Kotoha, who spend their time playing make-believe and exploring the city. The Colors' activities are facilitated by the grandfatherly Daigorou ""Pops"" Kujiraoka, who uses his store's inventory of knick-knacks to entertain the rambunctious trio.

Not everyone is a fan of the Colors though. The local policeman Saitou just wants to deal with his regular duties, but he often finds himself the target of the Colors' attention, having been made the villain in most of their fantasies. But despite his personal feelings, Saitou always finds the time to go along with the three girls' games. Even though the Colors do not actually defend Ueno, they definitely help brighten everyone's day.

Freedom,,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1747/Freedom,7.37,"2041, Earth. After being pulled into the planet's atmosphere, the fall of the Freeport Space Station has led to the ""Great Cataclysm""—an event that devastated the Earth's environment. Left as a polluted wasteland, survivors go to war with their fellows to guarantee themselves resources; in the end, these scrimmages have erased the whole existence of humanity. Coincidentally, life still exists on a moon base. Although it is supposedly meant as an immigration outpost for the mission to explore Mars, it is soon turned into a city, both regulating and allowing its citizens to flourish. The lunar base, officially named ""The City of Eden,"" holds the hope of fully colonizing the moon.

Takeru, one of many citizens of Eden in the year 2267, participates in ""Tube Races"" between gangs and groups using hovercraft-like vehicles. Due to causing an accident in one of his races, Takeru is sentenced to complete volunteer work outside the city. While clearing his punishment, Takeru stumbles upon remains that may unravel the truth about Earth and Eden's genesis.
