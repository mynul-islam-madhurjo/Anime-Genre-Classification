However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her life, which has lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her ""usual"" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.

As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.

When Haruko informs the basketball team's captain of Hanamichi's near-inhuman physical capabilities, he slowly finds himself drawn into the camaraderie and competition of the sport he had previously held resentment for.

That is, until the national government tasks them with eliminating the greatest threat to their planet: their new teacher. 

Having already destroyed the moon, the octopus-like professor—dubbed ""Koro-sensei""—has now threatened to destroy the Earth by March of the following year. In light of their mission, the students have found that killing him is easier said than done.

Through trial and error, Nagisa Shiota, as well as the other students of Class 3-E, must figure out Koro-sensei's weaknesses—and fast, for the very fate of the world depends upon it.
